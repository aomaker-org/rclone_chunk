Okay, creating a Python script (`chunk_rclone.py`) with a `config.toml` file for managing this chunked `rclone copy` operation is an excellent and more structured approach! This will be more maintainable and flexible than a bash script for more complex logic.

This is a great "mini-project." Let's outline the plan and then start drafting the Python script and `config.toml`.

**Project Goal:** Create a Python script that runs `rclone copy` in timed chunks, logs each chunk's activity, and allows for easy resumption of the overall copy process.

**Core Components:**

1.  **`config.toml`:** For all user-configurable parameters.
2.  **`chunk_rclone.py`:** The Python script to orchestrate the process.

---

**1. `config.toml` Structure:**

This file will store settings like paths, `rclone` options, and chunking parameters.

```toml
# config.toml

title = "Chunked Rclone Copy Configuration"

[rclone_paths]
remote_name = "gaom"  # Your rclone remote name
source_path = "My Drive/2025_Personal" # Path on the remote to the source folder
# Destination parent path on the remote. The actual backup folder will be a subdirectory here or this exact path.
destination_parent_path = "My Drive" 
# Base name for the backup folder. Chunks will copy into this.
backup_folder_name = "20250523_Personal_bak_chunked_py" 

[rclone_options]
# Add rclone global flags and copy command flags here
# For example, to control API usage and logging:
# Using arrays for flags that can take multiple values or for clarity
flags = [
    "--verbose", # Or "--very-verbose" / "-vv"
    "--tpslimit", "8",
    "--tpslimit-burst", "10",
    "--retries", "5",
    "--checkers", "4",
    "--transfers", "2", # For server-side, controls concurrent operations rclone asks for
    "--drive-server-side-across-configs", # Ensure server-side if applicable
    "--stats-one-line",
    "--stats", "30s" # How often rclone prints stats
]
# Consider adding --immutable if source files won't change during the whole process
# Or specific backend flags like --drive-stop-on-upload-limit

[chunking]
run_duration = "1h"  # Duration for each rclone chunk (e.g., "30m", "1h", "2h")
                     # Format should be understandable by 'timeout' command or parsed by Python

[logging]
# Local directory to store rclone log files for each chunk
log_dir = "rclone_chunk_logs" # Relative to where chunk_rclone.py is run, or make it an absolute path
# Base name for individual chunk log files (timestamp will be added)
log_file_basename = "rclone_copy_chunk"
# Optional: Path on rclone remote to upload logs to after each chunk
upload_logs_to_remote = true # true or false
remote_log_dir = "My Drive/Rclone_Project_Logs/ChunkedCopy" # Path on remote to store logs
```

---

**2. `chunk_rclone.py` Python Script - Initial Structure and Logic:**

The Python script will need to:
* Read `config.toml`.
* Construct the `rclone` command.
* Manage the execution of `rclone` using `subprocess` and handle the timeout.
* Manage logging.

**High-Level Python Script Logic:**

1.  **Imports:** `toml`, `subprocess`, `datetime`, `pathlib`, `sys`, `os`, `time` (maybe `shlex` for command construction).
2.  **Load Configuration:** Function to load `config.toml`.
3.  **Main Orchestration Function:**
    * Determine source and destination paths for `rclone` from config.
    * Create local log directory if it doesn't exist.
    * Generate a unique log filename for the current chunk (e.g., with a timestamp).
    * Construct the full `rclone copy` command, including the `--log-file` option pointing to the chunk-specific log.
    * Print information about the chunk being started (source, dest, duration, log file).
    * Execute the `rclone` command using `subprocess.run()` or `subprocess.Popen()`.
        * Implement a timeout mechanism. Python's `subprocess.run(timeout=...)` is ideal.
    * Capture the exit code.
    * Print a summary of the chunk's execution (success, timeout, error).
    * Optionally, upload the generated log file to the specified Google Drive location using another `rclone` command.
    * Advise the user to re-run the script for the next chunk.

**Refining Chunk Duration and Timeout:**
The `run_duration` in `config.toml` (e.g., "1h") will need to be parsed into seconds for Python's `subprocess.run(timeout=...)`.

**Initial `parse_duration_to_seconds` Refinement:**
The `parse_duration_to_seconds` needs to handle the original string for error messages. And it should probably not return `None` but raise an error or return 0 to signal failure to parse. For `subprocess.run`, `timeout=None` means no timeout, `0` might mean immediate. So `None` is actually okay if parsing fails and we want to signal "no valid timeout set". Let's make it raise ValueError if it cannot parse.

A simpler duration parser or just ask user to input seconds in config.
For "1h", "30m" etc., `timeout` command handles it. Python's `subprocess.run` needs seconds.

Revised `parse_duration_to_seconds` to be more robust or simpler by requiring a specific format like "Ns", "Nm", "Nh".
The `timeout` command in bash is more flexible with "1h", "30m". Python's `subprocess.run(timeout=...)` strictly needs seconds.

Let's simplify: The TOML can store `run_duration_seconds`.
`config.toml` change:
```toml
[chunking]
run_duration_seconds = 3600  # Duration for each rclone chunk in seconds (e.g., 3600 for 1h)
```
This simplifies the Python script.

The Python script needs `shlex.quote` when displaying the command to make it copy-pasteable if it has spaces. `subprocess.run` takes a list of arguments, so it handles spaces in individual arguments correctly without needing shell quoting internally.

This is a good starting point for `chunk_rclone.py` and `config.toml`. We can refine it further, add more error checking, and make the logging more sophisticated.
The `shlex.quote` part is for displaying the command in the print statement. The `cmd` list itself is passed to `subprocess.run`.
Consider a `try...except KeyboardInterrupt` in `run_rclone_chunk` to catch Ctrl+C and provide a cleaner message. `subprocess.run` should handle SIGINT passed to the child `rclone` process.

Let's present this refined structure.This is an excellent idea to create a more robust and configurable Python script for managing the large `rclone copy` operation in timed chunks! Using a `config.toml` file is perfect for this.

Let's outline the structure for `chunk_rclone.py` and a corresponding `config.toml`.

---
**1. `config.toml` (Configuration File)**
---
This file will hold all the settings. Create a file named `config.toml` in the same directory as your Python script.

```toml
# config.toml

title = "Chunked Rclone Copy Configuration"

[rclone_paths]
# Your rclone remote name (e.g., "gaom" as you've used)
remote_name = "gaom"  

# Path on the remote to the source folder you want to copy
# Example: "My Drive/2025_Personal"
source_path = "My Drive/2025_Personal" 

# Parent path on the remote where the backup folder will be created/updated
# Example: "My Drive" (backup folder will be created inside this)
# Example: "My Drive/Backups" (backup folder will be My Drive/Backups/your_backup_folder_name)
destination_parent_path = "My Drive" 

# Name of the backup folder. rclone will copy source_path *into* this folder.
# Example: "20250523_Personal_bak_chunked"
# The final destination for rclone will be remote_name:destination_parent_path/backup_folder_name
backup_folder_name = "20250523_Personal_bak_py" 

[rclone_options]
# Add rclone global flags and copy command flags here as a list of strings.
# Each flag or value should be a separate string in the list.
# Example: flags = ["-vv", "--tpslimit", "5", "--retries", "5"]
flags = [
    "-vv",                     # Very verbose logging from rclone (shows individual files, debug info)
    "--tpslimit", "8",         # Limit API transactions per second (e.g., 8)
    "--tpslimit-burst", "10",  # Allow short bursts up to 10 TPS
    "--retries", "5",          # Retry failed operations 5 times
    "--checkers", "4",         # Number of parallel file checkers
    "--transfers", "2",        # Number of parallel file transfers (for server-side, this is operations)
    # "--drive-server-side-across-configs", # Usually default for same remote copy, but can be explicit
    "--stats-one-line",        # More compact progress stats
    "--stats", "30s"           # Print stats every 30 seconds
]

[chunking]
# Duration for each rclone chunk in seconds.
# Example: 3600 for 1 hour, 1800 for 30 minutes.
run_duration_seconds = 3600  

[logging]
# Local directory (relative to this script) to store rclone log files for each chunk.
log_dir = "rclone_chunk_logs_py" 
# Base name for individual chunk log files (timestamp will be added).
log_file_basename = "rclone_copy_chunk"

# Optional: Upload chunk logs to Google Drive
upload_logs_to_remote = true
# Path on the rclone remote to store log files (will be created if it doesn't exist)
# Example: "My Drive/ProjectLogs/RcloneChunkCopy"
remote_log_upload_path = "My Drive/20250523_Personal/RcloneChunkLogs"

**How to Use:**

1.  **Save Files:**
    * Save the TOML content as `config.toml`.
    * Save the Python code as `chunk_rclone.py`.
2.  **Install `toml` library for Python:**
    ```bash
    pip install toml 
    ```
    (Or `pip3 install toml` depending on your Python setup). You're using a `(venv)`, so `pip install toml` within your activated venv is perfect.
3.  **Configure `config.toml`:**
    * Open `config.toml` and carefully edit all the path settings (`remote_name`, `source_path`, `destination_parent_path`, `backup_folder_name`) to match your Google Drive setup.
    * Adjust `rclone_options.flags` as desired. The defaults provided are reasonable for being a "good citizen" and getting verbose logs.
    * Set `chunking.run_duration_seconds` (e.g., `3600` for one hour).
    * Configure `logging` section, especially `log_dir` and `remote_log_upload_path` if you want to upload logs.
4.  **Make `chunk_rclone.py` executable (optional):**
    ```bash
    chmod +x chunk_rclone.py
    ```
5.  **Run the Script:**
    ```bash
    python3 chunk_rclone.py 
    ```
    (or `./chunk_rclone.py` if executable and in the current directory).
6.  **Monitor:** The script will print what it's doing and the `rclone` output (including stats if `rclone` is printing them) will also go to your console and the chunk-specific log file.
7.  **Resume:** When a chunk finishes (either by completing all work, timing out, or Ctrl+C), you can simply re-run `python3 chunk_rclone.py`. `rclone copy` will intelligently check what's already in the destination and only copy remaining/changed files.

**Key improvements in this Python version:**
* **Configuration Driven:** Easy to change parameters without editing the script.
* **Clearer Logging:** Python script manages its own logs and tells you where `rclone`'s detailed log for the chunk is.
* **Robust Path Handling:** Uses `pathlib` for some path constructions.
* **Error Handling:** More structured `try...except` blocks.
* **Timeout Management:** Uses Python's `subprocess.run(timeout=...)`.

This provides a solid foundation. We can add more features later, like automatically re-running until completion, more sophisticated log analysis, etc., but this meets your initial request for a chunked, logged, and resumable `rclone` process managed by Python.
